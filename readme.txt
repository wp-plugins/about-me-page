Create your about me page in seconds, with different themes.

== Description ==
In these days it takes a long time to express yourself, or sometimes it is very difficult to choose design. I have made different ready to use designs for about me page. Just place shortcode [about-me] in page and change settings from admin. 

== Installation ==
1. Go to plugins in your dashboard and select \'add new\'
2. Search for \'About Me Page\' and install it
3. Go to Dashboard > About Me and set your desired settings
4. Use this shortcode [about-me] in any page
5. Now visit that page
